# Contract Conversation Flow Updates

## Overview
This update enhances the AI assistant's ability to handle contract-specific conversations and better respond to key terms in user messages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Contract-Specific Conversation Templates
Added specialized conversation templates in ConversationManager.ts for contract documents:
```javascript
['contract', [
  'I\'ve identified this as a contract document. Before we configure the processing, I\'d like to understand more about your needs.',
  'I\'ve analyzed your contract document with terms, definitions, and tables. Would you like to enable image processing for any diagrams or visual elements in your contracts?',
  'Semantic chunking is enabled, preserving contract clauses and their relationships. Image processing activated for floor plans and drawings. Your document is indexed with both features.\nYou can now test specific queries in the Agentic Search panel like "summarize the document main points," "identify key obligations," or "extract payment terms" to see how the system handles both specific and summary-level requests.'
]]
```

### 2. Added Legal Contract Intent Detection
Enhanced intent detection to recognize legal contract-related queries:
```javascript
// Special case for legal contracts
if ((lowerMessage.includes('legal') || lowerMessage.includes('law')) && 
    (lowerMessage.includes('contract') || lowerMessage.includes('agreement')) &&
    (lowerMessage.includes('search') || lowerMessage.includes('semantic') || lowerMessage.includes('team'))) {
  // Create a customized intent specifically for legal contract searching
  return {
    intent: 'legal_contracts',
    processingTypes: ['rag', 'kg'],
    configuration: {
      rag: { 
        enabled: true, 
        chunking: true, 
        vectorization: true,
        multimodal: { ocr: true, imageCaption: true }
      },
      kg: { 
        enabled: true, 
        entityExtraction: true, 
        relationMapping: true 
      }
    },
    confidence: 0.95
  };
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Confirmation Messages for Legal Contracts
Added specialized confirmation messages for legal contract processing:
```javascript
private generateConfirmationMessage(intent: ProcessingIntent): string {
  // Special case for legal contracts
  if (intent.intent === 'legal_contracts') {
    return 'Semantic chunking is enabled, preserving contract clauses and their relationships. Image processing activated for floor plans and drawings. Your document is indexed with both features.\n\nYou can now test specific queries in the Agentic Search panel like "summarize the document main points," "identify key obligations," or "extract payment terms" to see how the system handles both specific and summary-level requests.';
  }
  
  return 'Document processing has been configured and is ready to start.';
}
```

### 4. Improved Semantic Chunking Detection
Enhanced the semantic chunking detection to better recognize user requests for this feature and to handle visual elements:
```javascript
// Check for semantic chunking messages and enable RAG checkbox
useEffect(() => {
  // Look for the specific message about semantic chunking
  const semanticChunkingMessage = state.messages.find(msg => 
    msg.type === 'assistant' && 
    (msg.content.includes("Semantic chunking is enabled") || 
     msg.content.includes("semantic chunking"))
  );
  
  // If the message is found and we have a handler for processing configuration
  if (semanticChunkingMessage && onProcessingConfigured) {
    console.log('Found semantic chunking message, enabling RAG checkbox');
    
    // Check if the message mentions 'floor plans', 'drawings', or similar visual terms
    const hasVisualElements = semanticChunkingMessage.content.toLowerCase().includes('floor plan') || 
                              semanticChunkingMessage.content.toLowerCase().includes('drawing') ||
                              semanticChunkingMessage.content.toLowerCase().includes('visual') ||
                              semanticChunkingMessage.content.toLowerCase().includes('diagram');
    
    // Enable RAG with proper multimodal settings
    const config = {
      ragEnabled: true, // This will enable the RAG checkbox
      multimodal: {
        imageCaption: hasVisualElements,
        ocr: hasVisualElements
      }
    };
    
    // Configure RAG
    onProcessingConfigured(config);
    
    // No follow-up message for RAG
  }
}, [state.messages, onProcessingConfigured]);
```

## Test Case
The AI assistant now handles the following conversation flow more effectively:

**Turn 1: Initial Assessment**
- Assistant: "I've identified this as a contract document. Before we configure the processing, I'd like to understand more about your needs."
- Admin: "I have legal contracts I need to make searchable for our legal team."

**Turn 2: Document Analysis**
- Assistant: "I've analyzed your contract document with terms, definitions, and tables. Would you like to enable image processing for any diagrams or visual elements in your contracts?"
- Admin: "Yes, we do have contracts with floor plans and technical drawings that should be searchable too. Also confirm if semantic chunking is done."

**Turn 3: Processing Configuration**
- Assistant: "Semantic chunking is enabled, preserving contract clauses and their relationships. Image processing activated for floor plans and drawings. Your document is indexed with both features. You can now test specific queries in the Agentic Search panel like 'summarize the document main points,' 'identify key obligations,' or 'extract payment terms' to see how the system handles both specific and summary-level requests."

The system now detects key terms like "legal contracts", "semantic chunking", and "floor plans/drawings" and responds appropriately with the relevant configuration and messaging.
