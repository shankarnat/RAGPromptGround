# Fix: Image Caption Toggle Synchronization

## Problem Summary
When user clicks "Yes, it has images", the Image Captioning switch doesn't update in the UI despite the state being updated.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The multimodal state update is happening
2. Toast notifications are showing
3. But the UI switch isn't reflecting the change
4. This suggests a prop propagation or rendering issue

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced State Logging
Added comprehensive logging at each step:
- useConversation: When image selection is made
- UnifiedDashboard: When configuration is received
- ManualConfigurationPanel: When props are passed
- CombinedConfigurationPanel: When multimodal state is rendered

### 2. State Initialization Fix
Ensure multimodal state is properly initialized with defaults:
```javascript
const existingMultimodal = prev.rag.multimodal || {
  transcription: false,
  ocr: false,
  imageCaption: false,
  visualAnalysis: false
};
```

### 3. Proper State Merging
Use spread operator to preserve existing state:
```javascript
multimodal: {
  ...existingMultimodal,
  ...multimodal
}
```

### 4. Debug Points Added
- `Passing multimodal to CombinedConfigurationPanel:` - Shows what's being passed
- `MultimodalSection render - multimodalProcessing:` - Shows what's being rendered

## Testing Steps

1. Open browser console
2. Upload a document
3. Click "Yes, it has images"
4. Check console logs for state flow
5. Verify switch state in UI

## Expected Behavior

1. Click "Yes, it has images"
2. Console shows multimodal update with imageCaption: true
3. Toast notification appears
4. Image Captioning switch toggles to ON
5. Other multimodal options remain unchanged

## Key Implementation Details

### State Flow
```
User Action → useConversation → UnifiedDashboard → processingConfig update → 
ManualConfigurationPanel re-render → CombinedConfigurationPanel update → 
MultimodalSection switch update
```

### State Preservation
- All existing multimodal settings are preserved
- Only the specific option (imageCaption) is updated
- RAG must be enabled for the section to show

## Common Pitfalls Avoided

1. **Race Conditions**: Used setTimeout for proper state propagation
2. **State Overwriting**: Used spread operator to merge states
3. **Missing Defaults**: Initialize multimodal with all options
4. **Prop Drilling**: Ensure props are passed through all levels

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Console shows multimodal config with imageCaption: true
- [ ] Toast notification appears
- [ ] RAG configuration section expands
- [ ] Image Captioning switch is checked
- [ ] Other switches maintain their state
- [ ] No console errors
