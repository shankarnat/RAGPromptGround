# Contract Conversation Flow Fixes

## Fixed Issues

1. **Corrected Conversation Sequence**
   - Fixed an issue where mentioning "legal contracts search for the legal team" would incorrectly trigger immediate semantic chunking response
   - Ensured proper step-by-step flow with Document Analysis between Initial Assessment and Processing Configuration

2. **Keep Chat Open After Final Message**
   - Added a `keepChatOpen` flag to prevent the conversation from being marked as complete
   - Modified confirmation step to check this flag before setting `isComplete` state
   - Applied to both direct message flow and button click flow

## Conversation Flow Sequence

The system now correctly follows this exact sequence:

### Turn 1: Initial Assessment
- **Assistant**: "I've identified this as a contract document. Before we configure the processing, I'd like to understand more about your needs."
- **User mentions**: "legal contracts" + "searchable" + "legal team"

### Turn 2: Document Analysis (MUST come after Turn 1)
- **Assistant**: "I've analyzed your 'Contract_Agreement.pdf' (42 pages) with terms, definitions, and tables. Would you like to enable image processing for any diagrams or visual elements in your contracts?"
- **User mentions**: "floor plans" + "drawings" + "semantic chunking"

### Turn 3: Processing Configuration (MUST come after Turn 2)
- **Assistant**: "Semantic chunking is enabled, preserving contract clauses and their relationships. Image processing activated for floor plans and drawings..."

## Implementation Details

1. **Fixed Conversation Sequence Check**
```javascript
// Only proceed if previous message was about image processing
if (lastAssistantMessage && lastAssistantMessage.content.includes('image processing')) {
  // Pass the actual user message rather than generating one
  return this.handleAction('custom_contract_flow', { 
    step: 'processing_confirmation',
    userResponse: message, // Use the actual user message
    keepChatOpen: true     // Flag to keep chat open
  }, { ...state, messages: newMessages });
}
```

2. **Keep Chat Open Flag**
```javascript
// Only mark as complete if keepChatOpen is not true
newState.isComplete = !data.keepChatOpen;
```

3. **Applied to Button Actions**
```javascript
{ 
  label: 'Yes, we do have contracts with floor plans and technical drawings that should be searchable too. Also confirm if semantic chunking is done.', 
  action: 'custom_contract_flow', 
  data: { 
    step: 'processing_confirmation',
    userResponse: '...',
    keepChatOpen: true
  } 
}
```

These changes ensure the conversation follows the exact required sequence and keeps the chat interface open for further interaction after the final confirmation message.
