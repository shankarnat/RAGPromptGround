# Multimodal Toggle Fix Test

## Problem
The checkboxes (Images and Audio Transcription) get selected then immediately unselected when chosen in AI assistant.

## Solution
Added an `isUpdatingFromAI` flag to prevent conflicting state updates between the AI-driven updates and manual configuration sync.

## Changes Made:

1. Added `isUpdatingFromAI` state in UnifiedDashboard component
2. Set the flag to true when updates come from AI assistant
3. Check the flag in `handleOptionToggle` and `handleProcessingToggle` to skip updates while AI is updating
4. Clear the flag after AI updates are complete
5. Added delays to ensure proper state synchronization

## Test Procedure:

1. Open the unified dashboard
2. Select a PDF document
3. Chat with AI assistant and select "Yes, it has images"
4. Verify that Image Captioning checkbox gets checked and stays checked
5. Select "Yes, audio transcription needed"
6. Verify that Audio Transcription checkbox gets checked and stays checked
7. Try manual configuration changes and ensure they work properly

## Expected Behavior:

- When selecting image/audio options in AI chat, the corresponding checkboxes should be checked automatically
- The checkboxes should remain checked and not toggle off immediately
- Toast notifications should appear correctly
- Manual configuration should still work normally
