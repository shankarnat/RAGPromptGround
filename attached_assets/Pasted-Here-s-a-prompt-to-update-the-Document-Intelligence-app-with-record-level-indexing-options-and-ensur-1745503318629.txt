Here's a prompt to update the Document Intelligence app with record level indexing options and ensure proper layout of all options on the right side:

# Prompt for Replit: Update Document Intelligence App with Expanded Indexing Options

Please update the Document Intelligence Center application with the following specific layout and content changes:

## 1. Configure Index Page Layout Adjustments:

- **Right Panel - Full Height Utilization:**
  - Expand configuration options to occupy the entire right panel, not just the bottom portion
  - Implement proper scrolling for the right panel if content exceeds visible height
  - Ensure all configuration sections are equally prominent and accessible

- **Add Record Level Indexing Section:**
  - Add a prominent "Record Level Indexing" section to the right panel
  - Include toggle for enabling/disabling record level indexing
  - Add configuration options specific to record-level processing:
    - Create vector embedding from record level chunk option
    - Configurable JSON paths for record fields
    - Record chunk size settings

- **Comprehensive Field Configuration:**
  - Include all indexing options on the right panel, organized in clear sections:
    1. Field Level Indexing (moved from Parse & Chunk page)
    2. Record Level Indexing (newly added)
    3. Retrievable Fields configuration
    4. Filterable Fields options
    5. Typehead Fields settings

## 2. Right Panel Organization:

- Add collapsible section headers for each configuration category
- Implement a tabbed interface at the top of the right panel to switch between different configuration types
- Include explanatory text for each option type
- Add visual indicators showing which options are enabled
- Ensure the "FAQ" section remains accessible but doesn't take space from configuration options

## 3. Middle Panel Integration:

- Update the middle panel preview to reflect both field-level and record-level indexing
- Show visual difference between field chunks and record chunks
- Provide real-time preview of how changes to indexing configuration affect the document

## 4. Navigation and State Management:

- Ensure all configuration options are saved when moving between steps
- Add a "Apply Changes" button that updates the preview in real time
- Include "Reset to Defaults" option for each configuration section

## Visual Implementation Requirements:

- Maintain consistent styling with the existing application
- Use appropriate icons to differentiate between field and record level options
- Add visual emphasis to currently active configuration sections
- Implement responsive layout that works well at different screen sizes

The goal is to create a comprehensive configuration interface where all indexing options (field level, record level, retrievable, filterable, and typehead) are clearly presented on the right panel, with real-time preview in the middle panel showing how these settings affect the document processing.
