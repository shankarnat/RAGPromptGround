Here's a prompt to update the Document Intelligence app with the specified changes:

# Prompt for Replit: Update Document Intelligence App Layout Structure

Please update the Document Intelligence Center application to implement the following structural changes to ensure proper progression through the workflow:

## 1. Parse & Chunk Page Updates:

- **Remove "Field Level Indexing" component** from the right panel
- Keep focus on chunking visualization and strategies in this view
- Right panel should only contain chunking configuration options:
  - Chunking method selection (Semantic, Fixed Size, Header-based)
  - Size and overlap sliders
  - Basic metadata about chunks
- Maintain the document preview and chunked output in the middle panel

## 2. Configure Index Page Implementation:

- Create a new "Configure Index" page that appears after the Parse & Chunk step
- **Left panel**: Same navigation sidebar, highlighting "Configure Index" as current step
- **Middle panel**: Show interactive preview of indexed content with:
  - Tabs for switching between original document, chunks, and record index views
  - Visual representation of how fields are being indexed
  - JSON-style preview of indexed records
- **Right panel**: Add comprehensive field configuration options:
  - **Add "Field Level Indexing"** component moved from Parse & Chunk page
  - Include "Retrievable Fields" section with explanation and toggle options
  - Add "Filterable Fields" section with configuration controls
  - Include "Typehead Fields" section with options
  - Each section should have proper explanations and configuration controls

## 3. Test & Results Page:

- Maintain the test interface in the middle panel:
  - Query input field
  - Results display
  - Source attribution
  - Performance metrics
- Right panel should show summary of all configurations from previous steps
- Include Back/Next/Save navigation buttons

## Visual Consistency Requirements:

- Maintain consistent styling across all pages
- Use same component designs, colors, and interaction patterns
- Ensure smooth transitions between workflow steps
- Preserve all user selections when navigating between pages

The goal is to create a more logical progression through the workflow, where users first parse and chunk their document, then configure indexing options in a dedicated step, before finally testing and reviewing the complete configuration.
