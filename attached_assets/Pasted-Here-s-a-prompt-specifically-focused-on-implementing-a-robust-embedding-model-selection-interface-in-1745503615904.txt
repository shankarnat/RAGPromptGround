Here's a prompt specifically focused on implementing a robust embedding model selection interface in the vectorization section:

# Prompt for Replit: Enhance Vectorization Section with Comprehensive Embedding Model Selection

Update the Document Intelligence Center application to include a robust embedding model selection interface in the vectorization section with the following specifications:

## Vectorization UI Requirements:

1. **Embedding Model Dropdown:**
   - Create a prominent dropdown menu labeled "Select Embedding Model"
   - Include a diverse range of embedding models including:
     - OpenAI models (text-embedding-ada-002, text-embedding-3-small, text-embedding-3-large)
     - E5 models (E5-small, E5-base, E5-large)
     - Cohere models (embed-english-v3.0, embed-multilingual-v3.0)
     - BERT-based models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, all-mpnet-base-v2)
     - Sentence transformers (sentence-t5-xxl)
   - Group models by provider with clear visual distinction

2. **Model Information Display:**
   - For each selected model, show key specs:
     - Dimension count (e.g., 1536 dimensions)
     - Supported languages
     - Maximum token length
     - Relative performance metrics (speed vs. quality indicator)
   - Include a small info icon with tooltip showing model details

3. **Advanced Configuration Options:**
   - Add toggles for:
     - Normalize embeddings
     - Use pooling strategy dropdown (mean, max, cls token)
     - Truncation handling method
   - Include batch size configuration for processing
   - Add option to enable/disable caching

## Visual Implementation:

1. **Model Selection Card:**
   - Create a visually distinct card for the vectorization section
   - Include a "Vectorization" header with appropriate icon
   - Make the model dropdown the most prominent element
   - Add visual indicators for recommended/popular models

2. **Interactive Elements:**
   - Implement a "Test Embedding" button that shows sample vector output
   - Add dimension visualization that updates based on selected model
   - Include performance comparison tooltip when hovering between models

3. **Layout Integration:**
   - Position the vectorization section prominently in the workflow
   - Ensure the dropdown is easily accessible and visually prominent
   - Maintain consistent styling with the rest of the application

## Technical Implementation:

1. **Dropdown Functionality:**
   - Implement search filtering within the dropdown
   - Include model logos/icons next to each option
   - Show recently used models at the top 
   - Preserve selection across workflow navigation

2. **Information Display:**
   - Create collapsible sections for detailed model information
   - Update displayed information based on selected model
   - Include links to model documentation where appropriate

The vectorization section should be visually appealing, informative, and intuitive, allowing users to easily select from a variety of embedding models while understanding the tradeoffs between different options.
