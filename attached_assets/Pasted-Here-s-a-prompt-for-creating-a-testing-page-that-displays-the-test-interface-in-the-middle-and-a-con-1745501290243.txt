Here's a prompt for creating a testing page that displays the test interface in the middle and a configuration summary on the right:

# Prompt for Replit: Create Test & Results Page with Configuration Summary

Implement a "Test & Results" page for the Document Intelligence Center that follows the layout shown in the reference image. This page should be the final step in the workflow, displaying a testing interface in the middle panel while summarizing all configuration choices in the right panel.

## Layout Requirements

1. **Left Panel (Navigation):**
   - Maintain the existing sidebar with workflow steps
   - Show checkmarks for completed steps (Select Search Type, Vectorization, Configure Index, Ranking)
   - Highlight "Review and Build" as the active step
   - Keep the same visual styling as in the reference image

2. **Middle Panel (Test Interface):**
   - Create tabs for "Original Document", "Chunks", "Record Index", and "Test" (with "Test" selected by default)
   - Implement a test query interface as shown in the reference image with:
     - "Test Query" header
     - Text input field with example query ("What were Q1 revenue figures?")
     - "Run" button
     - "Answer" section displaying the response
     - "Sources" section showing where the answer was derived from
     - "Evaluation Results" section with metrics (Accuracy, Latency, Tests Passed)
   - Include a "Refresh Preview" button at the top left

3. **Right Panel (Configuration Summary):**
   - Add "Frequently Asked Questions" header
   - Display a comprehensive summary of all configurations chosen in previous steps:
     - Source document/data model information
     - Embedding model details
     - Field indexing choices
     - Retrievable and filterable fields count
     - Chunking strategy
   - Add a "What happens next?" section explaining the deployment process
   - Include a "Learn More" link

## Key Components

1. **Test Interface Features:**
   - Functional query input with sample question
   - Response display area with formatted answer
   - Source attribution section
   - Performance metrics dashboard showing:
     - Accuracy percentage
     - Response latency
     - Number of tests passed

2. **Configuration Summary:**
   - Structured summary of all choices made across previous screens
   - Each section should have:
     - Clear header
     - Checkmark icon
     - Summary of selections
     - Edit button for quick navigation back to that step
   - Include specific details like:
     - "Source DMO: Financial Report"
     - "Vectorization: Embedding model: E5 Large V2 Embedding Model"
     - "Fields: Field Level Indexing: 4, Record Level Indexing: 4"
     - "Other Configurations: Retrievable Fields: 4, Filtering Fields: 4"

## Visual Style

- Match the exact color scheme and styling from the reference image
- Use the same blue header with "New Configuration" title
- Include Back/Next/Save buttons in the same positions
- Use identical icons, metrics displays, and visual indicators
- Maintain the same accordion-style sections for the configuration summary

## Technical Implementation

- Create a simulated query-response system
- Display realistic but pre-defined answers to sample queries
- Show appropriate source attribution
- Implement tabs that allow switching between different views of the document

## Integration

- Ensure this screen appears as the final step in the workflow
- Preserve all configuration choices from previous steps
- Allow users to navigate back to adjust settings if needed

This implementation will provide users with a comprehensive testing interface to validate their document intelligence configuration while displaying a complete summary of all chosen settings in the right panel.
