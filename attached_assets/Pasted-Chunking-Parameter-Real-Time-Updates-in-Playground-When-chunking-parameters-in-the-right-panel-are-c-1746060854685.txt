Chunking Parameter Real-Time Updates in Playground
When chunking parameters in the right panel are changed, the following updates occur in the playground in real-time:

Visual Updates
Dynamic Rechunking

Document chunks are immediately recalculated and redrawn
Animated transitions show chunks merging or splitting
Color-coded highlighting indicates new chunk boundaries
Chunk Statistics Update

Total chunk count updates in real-time
Average chunk size (tokens/characters) recalculates
Token usage metrics refresh to show efficiency
Chunk Preview Rendering

Each chunk is visually represented with clear separation
Overlap regions are highlighted with a distinct pattern/color
Chunk IDs and sequence numbers adjust accordingly
Parameter-Specific Effects
When Chunk Size is Changed
Larger values: Fewer, longer chunks appear with expanded content
Smaller values: More numerous, shorter chunks with focused content
Visual ruler shows approximate token/character count within each chunk
When Chunk Overlap is Modified
Increased overlap: Highlighted overlap regions expand between chunks
Decreased overlap: Less duplication between adjacent chunks
Overlap visualization shows shared tokens in a distinct color
When Chunking Method is Switched
Semantic → Fixed: Transitions from meaning-based to uniform-sized chunks
Fixed → Header: Reorganizes around document headings with clear section markers
Header → Semantic: Adapts to content meaning with natural language groupings
User Interface Feedback
Performance Indicators

Processing time indicator shows chunking efficiency
Memory usage estimates update based on chunk configuration
Warning indicators appear if parameters create too many/few chunks
Quality Assessment

Semantic coherence score updates for each chunk
Context preservation visualization shows information retention
Retrieval effectiveness prediction based on chunk parameters
Interactive Elements

Hover over any chunk to see its metadata (token count, overlap percentage)
Click on chunk boundaries to manually adjust split points (with override indicator)
Drag interface to temporarily merge chunks for context viewing
Technical Behavior
Changes are processed with debouncing (200-300ms) to prevent excessive recalculation
Progressive rendering for large documents (chunks appear as they're processed)
Cached results for recent parameter combinations to reduce processing time
Local browser processing for immediate feedback before server confirmation
This real-time visualization helps users fine-tune their chunking strategy by immediately showing the impact of parameter changes on document segmentation, balancing between semantic coherence and retrieval efficiency.
