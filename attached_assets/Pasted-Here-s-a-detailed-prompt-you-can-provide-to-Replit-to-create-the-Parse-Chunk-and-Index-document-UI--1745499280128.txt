Here's a detailed prompt you can provide to Replit to create the Parse, Chunk and Index document UI screen:
Prompt for Replit to Create a Document Intelligence UI
Create a React-based Document Intelligence Center UI focused on the "Parse, Chunk and Index" screen. This interface should help users visualize and configure how their documents are processed for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications.
UI Structure Requirements

Navigation Sidebar:

Include options for a complete workflow: Dashboard, Upload Document, Parse & Chunk, Embed Vectors, IDP Extraction (marked as optional), Knowledge Graph (marked as optional), Build Pipeline, and Test & Deploy
Highlight "Parse & Chunk" as the active page
Use a clean, modern sidebar design with appropriate icons


Header Area:

Document title and metadata (e.g., "Financial_Report_Q1_2025.pdf â€¢ 24 pages")
Processing mode selector with options for "Standard," "IDP," and "KG" (Standard selected)
User avatar or initials in the top-right corner


Main Content Area:

Tab navigation with options: Split View, Document, Chunks, Field Index
Split view (default) showing:

Left panel: Original document with text in a monospaced font
Right panel: Generated chunks with token counts and extracted entities




Configuration Panel:

Chunking method selection (Semantic, Fixed Size, Header-based)
Chunk size and overlap sliders with numerical indicators
Field indexing section showing extracted fields with options to make them retrievable/filterable



Visual Design Requirements

Use a clean, light color scheme with blue accent colors for active elements
Ensure adequate whitespace and clear visual hierarchy
Use cards or panels with subtle shadows and borders to group related content
Include appropriate visual feedback for interactive elements
Implement a responsive layout that works well on larger screens

Interactions to Implement

Tab switching between different document views
Chunk method selection via radio buttons
Adjustable sliders for chunk size and overlap
Checkboxes for field configuration options
Next/Previous navigation buttons at the bottom

Technical Requirements

Build using React and a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS
Include sample document content and chunked output for demonstration
Implement basic state management for UI interactions
Focus on UI appearance and interactions, not backend functionality
Make sure styling is clean and consistent throughout the interface

The final result should look professional and match the style of modern web applications like LangFlow, making it intuitive for users to understand and configure document chunking and indexing options while seeing the results in real-time.
