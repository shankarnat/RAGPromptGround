Here's a prompt focused on updating the Parse & Chunk section to include record-level indexing for document metadata:

# Prompt for Replit: Update Parse & Chunk to Include Record-Level Document Metadata Indexing

Enhance the Parse & Chunk section of the Document Intelligence Center to support record-level indexing of document metadata. This feature will allow users to include document-wide attributes (like author, creation date, file type) as a unified JSON record alongside content chunks.

## Feature Requirements:

1. **Document Metadata Extraction:**
   - Add a "Document Metadata" panel to the Parse & Chunk interface
   - Automatically extract common metadata fields from uploaded documents:
     - Author/Creator
     - Creation date
     - Last modified date
     - Document title
     - File size and type
     - Source location/system
   - Allow users to view and edit extracted metadata

2. **Record-Level Indexing Configuration:**
   - Add a "Record-Level Indexing" toggle in the Parse & Chunk configuration
   - When enabled, show options for:
     - Which metadata fields to include in the record
     - How to structure the JSON record
     - Whether to include this as a separate chunk or combine with content chunks
   - Include preset templates for common document types (reports, emails, articles)

3. **Preview Updates:**
   - In the middle preview panel, add a "Document Record" tab alongside the chunks view
   - Show a formatted JSON preview of how the document-level record will be structured
   - Visually indicate which metadata fields are being included
   - Demonstrate how this record relates to the content chunks

## UI Implementation:

1. **Metadata Extraction Panel:**
   - Create a collapsible "Document Metadata" section in the right configuration panel
   - Show automatically extracted fields with confidence scores
   - Allow editing/correction of metadata values
   - Include "Add Custom Field" option for user-defined metadata

2. **Record Configuration:**
   - Add checkboxes for selecting which metadata to include
   - Create a "Record Structure" dropdown with options like:
     - Flat (all metadata at root level)
     - Nested (grouped by categories)
     - Custom (user-defined structure)
   - Include "Preview Record" button to show resulting JSON

3. **Visual Integration:**
   - Update the chunk visualization to show both:
     - Content chunks from the document body
     - The document-level metadata record
   - Use color coding to differentiate between content and metadata
   - Show relationships between the document record and content chunks

## Functional Benefits to Highlight:

1. **Search Improvements:**
   - Explain how document metadata enhances search relevance
   - Show how filtering by metadata (author, date, etc.) works
   - Demonstrate improved retrieval for document-level attributes

2. **Application Examples:**
   - Knowledge management: finding documents by author or department
   - Compliance: filtering content by creation date or document status
   - Research: grouping similar document types together

This update should seamlessly integrate document-level metadata into the chunking process, allowing for both granular content chunking and document-wide attribute indexing in a unified workflow.
