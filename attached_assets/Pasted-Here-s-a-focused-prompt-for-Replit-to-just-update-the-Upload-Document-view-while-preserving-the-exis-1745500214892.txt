Here's a focused prompt for Replit to just update the Upload Document view while preserving the existing Parse & Chunk functionality:

# Prompt for Replit: Add Document Upload & Selection Interface

Update the existing Document Intelligence Center application by enhancing the "Upload Document" view. The Parse & Chunk functionality should remain unchanged and accessible after document selection.

## Upload Document View Requirements

When "Upload Document" is clicked in the sidebar:

1. **Main Panel (Center):**
   - Create a clean upload interface with:
     - Drag and drop zone for files
     - "Browse files" button alternative
     - Supported file types indicator (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
     - Upload progress indicator that appears during file processing
     - Recently uploaded files section showing 3-5 previous documents

2. **Right Panel (Data Model Selection):**
   - Implement a data model selection table as shown in the screenshot
   - Include:
     - Radio button selectors in the first column
     - "Data Model Object" column (Chat Transcript, Contact, etc.)
     - "Object API Name" column with corresponding values
     - Highlighted row styling for the selected item
     - Scrollable list with at least 10-15 options
     - Light gray background for alternate rows
     - Thin separating borders between rows

3. **Navigation Controls:**
   - Add a "Next" button at the bottom that becomes enabled when both:
     - A file has been uploaded
     - A data model has been selected
   - Clicking "Next" should navigate to the Parse & Chunk view

## Integration Requirements

1. **State Preservation:**
   - The selected document and data model should be remembered when switching to Parse & Chunk
   - When returning to Upload Document view, previous selections should remain

2. **UI Consistency:**
   - Maintain the same styling, colors, and layout structure as the existing Parse & Chunk view
   - Keep the sidebar navigation highlighting the current active section

## Technical Notes

- Use the same React/Tailwind setup as the existing application
- No need to implement actual file processing - simulate with timeouts
- The data model options can be hardcoded to match the screenshot
- Focus only on the Upload Document view - don't modify the Parse & Chunk functionality

The goal is to create a seamless experience where users can select a document and data model type, then continue to the existing Parse & Chunk interface to process their document.
