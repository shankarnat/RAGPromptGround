Here's a focused prompt for updating your knowledge graph UX to handle Slack data mapping to activity, user, and content DMOs:

```
# Slack Activity Graph Integration - Knowledge Graph UX Enhancement

## Objective
Update the Knowledge Graph UX to support efficient mapping of Slack data to Activity-User-Content graph structure, with automated edge creation and intuitive data mapping.

## Data Source Mapping Requirements

### Slack Data Source Components
- User data (profiles, user IDs, metadata)
- Message data (text, timestamps, thread info, reactions)
- File data (shared files, attachments, links)
- Channel data (workspaces, channels, membership)
- Activity data (message posting, reactions, file sharing, mentions)

### Target DMO Structure
1. User DMO:
   - Maps directly to Slack user profiles
   - Key fields: user_id, display_name, email, title, team
   
2. Content DMO:
   - Maps to Slack messages and files
   - Message fields: message_id, text, timestamp, channel_id, thread_ts
   - File fields: file_id, filename, filetype, url, timestamp

3. Activity DMO:
   - Maps to user actions in Slack
   - Types: PostMessage, EditMessage, ReactToMessage, ShareFile, MentionUser, etc.
   - Fields: activity_id, activity_type, timestamp, actor_id, target_id

## UX Enhancement Requirements

### Template Selection Screen
- Add "Slack Activity Graph" as a prominent template option
- Show visual preview of the Activity-User-Content structure
- Include description: "Map Slack communication data to understand user interactions with content and other users"

### DMO Drag & Drop Interface
- Auto-populate Slack-specific DMOs when template is selected
- Allow drag-and-drop of User, Content, and Activity DMOs onto the canvas
- Visualize DMOs with Slack-themed icons for easy identification

### Automated Edge Creation
- Automatically generate the following edges when DMOs are placed:
  1. User → Content (Authored): When a user creates a message or uploads a file
  2. User → Content (Reacted): When a user reacts to a message
  3. User → Content (Edited): When a user edits their message
  4. User → Content (Mentioned): When content mentions a user
  5. User → User (Collaboration): When users interact in the same thread
  6. Activity → User (Performed By): Linking activities to users who performed them
  7. Activity → Content (Performed On): Linking activities to target content

### Field Mapping Interface
- Pre-populate field mappings for common Slack data structures
- Provide Slack-specific field descriptions and examples
- Include validation rules for Slack-specific data types
- Show sample data from Slack API for reference

### Edge Configuration UI Enhancements
- Edge type templates specific to Slack interactions
- Pre-configured conditions for Slack data relationships
- Visual distinction between direct and derived relationships
- Quick toggle for common Slack activity relationships

### Affinity Calculation Defaults
- "Who Knows Who" configuration optimized for Slack interaction patterns:
  - Weight message replies higher than reactions
  - Consider channel co-presence as weak connection
  - Account for direct message frequency
  
- "Who Does What" configuration tailored to Slack content:
  - Topic extraction from message content
  - File sharing and type expertise tracking
  - Channel topic expertise identification

## Implementation Guidance
- Use Slack API structure as reference for field naming and relationships
- Implement Slack-specific data validation during mapping
- Ensure datetime handling accounts for Slack's timestamp format
- Provide clear visual feedback when edges are auto-generated
- Allow easy customization of the default Slack template settings

## Success Criteria
- Users can create a complete Activity-User-Content graph from Slack data in 50% less time than manual configuration
- All key Slack interaction types are represented in the resulting knowledge graph
- Affinity calculations accurately reflect communication patterns within Slack
- Users can easily understand the meaning of auto-generated edges
```

This prompt provides specific guidance for updating your knowledge graph UX to handle Slack data, with a focus on the Activity-User-Content relationship model and automatic edge creation between these DMOs. It includes both technical requirements and UX considerations to ensure a smooth implementation.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
