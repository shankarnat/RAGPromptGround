Here's the updated prompt with the requested changes:

# Prompt for Replit: Add Indexing Configuration Screen to Document Intelligence Center

Enhance the Document Intelligence Center by adding a new "Configure Indexing" screen that follows the specific three-panel layout shown in your reference images, with modifications to the left panel navigation and adding index statistics to the middle panel.

## Layout Requirements

1. **Left Panel (Navigation):**
   - Maintain existing sidebar with workflow steps
   - **Remove all numeric step indicators** (no "3.", "4.", etc.)
   - Include checkmarks for completed steps (Select Search Type, Vectorization)
   - Highlight "Configure Index" as the active step
   - Include sub-options under Configure Index (Fields, Other Configurations)
   - Keep all other navigation options including IDP and KG as in previous designs

2. **Middle Panel (Playground/Preview with Statistics):**
   - Create an interactive preview area showing how document chunks are indexed
   - **Add statistics dashboard at the top** showing:
     - Total number of fields indexed
     - Number of retrievable fields
     - Number of filterable fields
     - Average chunk size
     - Total vector dimensions
   - Display a visual representation of indexed content with field mapping
   - Show expandable sections for different indexing types
   - Include JSON-like representation of indexed records
   - Implement a document preview with highlighting for different field types

3. **Right Panel (Configuration Options):**
   - Include "Frequently Asked Questions" header as shown in reference images
   - Create sections for specific indexing concepts:
     - "Field Level Indexing" explanation 
     - "Record Level Indexing" explanation
     - "Chunk Format Column" details
   - Add "Retrievable Fields" section exactly as in Image 2
   - Include "Typehead Fields" section from Image 2
   - Add "Filtering Fields" description from reference image
   - Include "Learn More" links for each section

## Configuration Elements

1. **Right Panel Options:**
   - Explicitly include these sections from Image 2:
     - Retrievable Fields explanation
     - Typehead Fields explanation
     - Filtering Fields explanation with examples
   - Maintain the exact layout with descriptive text and "Learn More" links

2. **Middle Playground with Statistics:**
   - **Add metrics dashboard** showing indexing statistics
   - Create visual indicators for index performance
   - Include data distribution graphs for indexed fields
   - Show expandable sections for:
     - Retrievable Fields (with "No fields selected" placeholder)
     - Typehead Fields (with "No fields selected" placeholder)
     - Filtering Fields (with "No fields selected" placeholder)
   - Include "Drag and drop fields for configuration" instructions
   - Show cloud icon placeholders when no fields are selected

3. **Indexing Configuration:**
   - Include all configuration options from the references:
     - Field Level Indexing with DMO and Chunking Strategy options
     - Record Level Indexing with Data Type and API Name fields
     - Toggles for "Create vector embedding from record level chunk"
     - Post processing options

## Visual Style

- Match the exact color scheme and styling from the reference images
- Use the same blue header with "New Configuration" title
- Include Back/Next/Save buttons in the same positions
- Implement the same accordion-style expandable sections
- Use identical icons and visual indicators

## Technical Implementation

- Create a functional attribute search as shown in the left section of the reference
- Allow dragging fields between different indexing types
- Implement dropdown menus for chunking strategies
- Include toggle switches for features

## Integration

- Ensure this screen maintains continuity with the Parse & Chunk view
- Preserve context about the document being processed
- Allow navigation between steps without losing configuration

The implementation should closely mirror the reference images while incorporating the requested changes - removing numbered steps from the left panel and adding statistical information about indexed data in the middle preview panel.
