4. Multimodal Check (Images) - RESTORED
5. Audio Check - RESTORED
6. OCR Check - RESTORED
7. Visual Analysis Check - RESTORED
8. Knowledge Graph Check
9. IDP Check (Document Data Extraction)
10. Confirmation

## Technical Changes Reverted

1. **Restored conversation steps in ConversationManager.ts**:
   - Changed `nextStep` back from `'kg_check'` to `'multimodal_check'` after processing selection
   - Restored all multimodal conversation step definitions
   - Restored ConversationState type to include multimodal steps

2. **Multimodal questions are now**:
   - Back in the AI conversation flow
   - Still synchronized with manual configuration panel toggles
   - Part of the complete 10-step conversation flow

## Current State

The conversation flow is now exactly as it was before:
- Questions flow through all multimodal options
- Each multimodal option can be selected in the AI conversation
- Selections sync with the manual configuration panel
- All handlers remain in place and functional

## Testing

To verify the restoration:
1. Start a new conversation
2. Proceed through user profile setup
3. Select processing methods
4. Verify multimodal questions appear in sequence:
   - Image indexing/analysis
   - Audio transcription 
   - OCR needs
   - Visual analysis
   - Image processing type
5. Continue to Knowledge Graph and IDP questions
6. Reach confirmation

All original functionality has been restored.
