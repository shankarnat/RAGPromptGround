# Document Loaded Results View Update

## Changes Made
Updated the center panel in the UnifiedDashboard to show the results view when a document is loaded, instead of just showing the upload panel.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Modified Center Panel Logic
- Added conditional rendering based on `state.selectedDocument`
- When no document is selected: Shows the upload panel
- When a document is selected: Shows the results view

### 2. Updated Panel Title and Description
- Changed from "Upload Document" to "Document Analysis & Results" when document is loaded
- Dynamic description based on processing status:
  - If processing completed: "View and explore the results from processing"
  - If document just loaded: "Document loaded. Configure processing options in the left panel or with AI assistant."

### 3. Progressive Loading Flow
1. User selects a document
2. ProgressiveDocumentLoader performs initial analysis
3. Once analysis is complete (`documentReady = true`), UnifiedResultsView is shown
4. Results view displays any available processing results

### 4. Code Structure
```tsx
{!state.selectedDocument ? (
  // Upload panel view
) : (
  // Results view with conditional rendering:
  {documentReady ? (
    <UnifiedResultsView ... />
  ) : (
    <ProgressiveDocumentLoader ... />
  )}
)}
```

## Benefits
1. Better user experience - users see results immediately after document selection
2. Eliminates need to navigate to a separate results view
3. Progressive loading ensures smooth transition from upload to analysis to results
4. Maintains context - document remains visible while configuring processing options

## Usage Flow
1. User opens unified dashboard
2. Selects or uploads a document
3. Center panel automatically switches to show document analysis
4. As processing is configured and executed, results appear in the same view
5. No need to switch between different steps/tabs to see results
