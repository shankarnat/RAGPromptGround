# Consistent Left Panel Configuration Across All Steps

## Changes Made
Updated the process and results steps to maintain the same left panel configuration as the upload step, ensuring consistency throughout the workflow.

## Implementation Details

### Upload Step (Original)
- Left panel: Full manual configuration (editable)
- Middle panel: Document upload/results view
- Right panel: AI assistant

### Process Step (Updated)
- **Left panel: Same manual configuration as upload (editable)**
- Middle panel: Processing status with pipeline visualization
- Right panel: AI assistant (monitoring progress)

### Results Step (Updated)
- **Left panel: Same manual configuration as upload (read-only)**
- Middle panel: Processing results view
- Right panel: AI assistant (explore results)

## Key Features

### Process Step Left Panel
```tsx
{/* Manual Configuration (same as upload) */}
<ResizablePanel defaultSize={30} minSize={20} maxSize={50}>
  {/* Processing Methods */}
  <Card>
    <CardHeader>
      <CardTitle>Processing Methods</CardTitle>
    </CardHeader>
    <CardContent>
      {/* Checkboxes for RAG, KG, IDP */}
    </CardContent>
  </Card>

  {/* Collapsible configuration sections */}
  <Accordion>
    {/* RAG, KG, IDP configurations */}
  </Accordion>
</ResizablePanel>
```

### Results Step Left Panel
```tsx
{/* Manual Configuration (same as upload/process) */}
<ResizablePanel defaultSize={30} minSize={20} maxSize={50}>
  {/* All configuration options but disabled={true} */}
  {/* Button changed to "Process Another Document" */}
</ResizablePanel>
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Users see the same configuration panel throughout the workflow
2. **Context Preservation**: Configuration settings remain visible at all times
3. **Better UX**: Users don't lose track of their configuration choices
4. **Clarity**: Results view shows what configuration was used for processing

## Differences Between Steps

- **Upload/Process**: Configuration is editable
- **Results**: Configuration is read-only (disabled checkboxes)
- Footer button changes:
  - Upload/Process: "Process Document"
  - Results: "Process Another Document"

The layout maintains complete consistency while adapting interaction based on the current step.
