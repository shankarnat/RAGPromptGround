# Fix Vehicle Information Step Navigation

## Issue
User reported being unable to proceed past the vehicle information collection step in the conversation flow. The conversation displayed "To provide the most accurate analysis, please provide vehicle information..." but clicking vehicle selection buttons like "2025 Honda Accord" didn't advance the conversation.

## Root Cause
Two issues were identified:

1. The `handleAction` method in `ConversationManager.ts` was missing case handlers for vehicle-related actions:
   - `set_vehicle` - for selecting a specific vehicle
   - `request_vin_input` - for entering a VIN
   - `request_vehicle_input` - for entering other vehicle details

2. The `useConversation` hook was not including these vehicle actions in the list of allowed actions, so they were being filtered out before reaching the ConversationManager.

## Solution
1. Added the missing action handlers in the `handleAction` method in `ConversationManager.ts`:

```typescript
case 'set_vehicle':
  newState.vehicleInfo = { 
    ...newState.vehicleInfo, 
    year: data.year,
    make: data.make,
    model: data.model 
  };
  newState.conversationStep = data.nextStep;
  break;
  
case 'request_vin_input':
case 'request_vehicle_input':
  // For now, we'll just move to the next step
  // In a real implementation, this would open an input dialog
  newState.conversationStep = data.nextStep;
  break;
```

2. Added the vehicle actions to the allowed actions list in `useConversation.ts`:

```typescript
if (['next_step', 'set_role', 'set_department', 'set_vehicle', 'request_vin_input', 
    'request_vehicle_input', 'set_experience', 'set_goal', 
    'set_urgency', 'set_detail', 'select_processing', 'set_has_images', 
    'set_has_audio', 'set_needs_ocr', 'set_visual_analysis', 'set_image_processing',
    'set_kg_preferences', 'set_kg_entities', 'set_idp_preferences', 'apply_recommendation'].includes(action)) {
```

## Result
The vehicle information step now properly:
1. Captures vehicle selection (year, make, model) in the state
2. Advances to the next conversation step (goals)
3. Handles VIN input requests by advancing the conversation

The conversation flow now works as designed:
- department → vehicle_info → goals → processing_selection
